phototimer
==========

This is a tiny web-based film photography timer I knocked up over
a bored lunchbreak.  The JS is fairly horrible, but there we go - it works..
Most of the other timers I could find were either loaded with ads/spyware/
rubbish or complete pay-for apps.  So a simple web based one I could
access from any device seemed like a good lunchtime project.

Should be hostable anywhere though only works with recent-ish 
browsers that support the audio/vibrate api's.

It should be running on my website at http://monkeytwizzle.com/phototimer/ .
